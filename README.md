Power BI is a standalone microsoft BI product, which includes both desktop and web based app for loading, modeling and visualising data.
Bnefits of using power BI:
1) We can connect, transform and millions of records from the database and we can access the data from anywhere and create fully automated data shaping and ETL
   procedures.
2) We can build relational models to blend data from multiple sources.
3) We can visualise data with interactive approach and reports.

Data model is defined when the tables are connected via relationships based on a primary key.

DAX is Data Analysis Expressions which is a formula language that drives power BI. With DAX we can add calculated columns and measures to the relationship tab and 
also by DAX we can go beyond the capabilities with powerful and flexible functions specifically to work with Data model.
